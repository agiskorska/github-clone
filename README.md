# Repo tracker

## Installation: 
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run dev`

## Usage:
Type in the name of the GitHub account you wish to browse. Voila. 
If you want, you can narrow down the results by entering a string to a searchbox. 
Use only the main page. Other pages are in development.

### Challenges: 
How to hide the searchbox for when there's no github username given?
